Go to Scratch for Budding Computer Scientists (link on bit.ly/SAHSCS) and answer the
following questions.

You will need to create a file that is named your username and paste your answers in it.
After you have completed the questions, submit a pull request in this same repository.

1) Why is there such a "learning curve" when learning a traditional programming
language such as Java?
You have to learn a whole new language and be very specific.

2) What is learning to program ultimately about?
Learnig to think logically and to approach the problems methodically.


3) How does Scratch "lower the bar" to programming?
It allows computer scientists to focus on problems rather than syntax.


4) What is a statement in a programming language?
A directive that tells the computer to do something.


5) What is a Boolean expression?
An expression that is either true or false.


6) What is a conditional statement?
Something must be true in order for something to happen.


7) What is a loop used for in a programming language?
It introduces multiple executions of a statement.


8) What is the difference between a local variable and a global variable?
A local variable is used by just one sprite. A global variable is used by all the sprites.


9) What is a Boolean variable?
A variable that is either true or false.


10) Which type of blocks in Scratch can be considered threads?
Any block whose label starts with when.


11) Which type of blocks in Scratch can be considered event handlers?
Any block that also begins with when.


12) How many sprites are implemented in Oscartime?
9


13) How many threads are used to display the Oscartime game instructions?
1


14) How many threads are used by Oscartime's Oscar sprite?
3



15) What programming constructs does Scratch NOT support?
Methods, parameters, return values, inheritance and polymorphism.
